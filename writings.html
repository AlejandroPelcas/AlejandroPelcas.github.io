  <ul>

    <li> 1. Make your bed (You accomplish the first task of the day and it'll motivate you to do more)</li>
    <li> 2. Drink a glass of water/tea in the morning  (You lose water in your sleep, so this helps your body rejuvinate)</li>
    <li> 3. Sleep and wake up at the same time as regularly as possible (A consistant sleep schedule reprograms your body to feel tired and awake at appropriate times)</li>
    <li> 4. Read at least for 15 minutes everyday (The average person reads 2 books a year. Doing this allows you to read about 20!)</li>
      <p> Studying </p>
    <li> 5. Study over a period of days instead of few hours (Memory retention works best when it doesn't have to remember a ton in one sitting)</li>
    <li> 6. Make a "cheat sheet" as you progress through the semester (This saves lots of time when midterm season kicks in and you already know what you should study!)</li>
    <li> 7. Have a go-to study playlist (this prevents you from having to switch/find songs and waste valuable time studying)</li>
    <li> 8. Everytime you study, do <em>one</em> of the following: chew gum,burn incense, drink tea, play certain music (after time, your brain will recognize these 'cues' and know it's time to grind enhancing performance) </li>
    <li> 9. Use mnemonics to help you memorize terms (makes learning fun if you're creative, and helps retain information)</li>
    <li> 10. <em>Teach someone concepts you're learning </em> ("If you can't simply explain it to someone, you don't understand it enough")</li>
    <li> 11. Go over the solution <em>immediately</em> after attempting a problem. (You get instant feedback and can quickly figure out if you need to revisit a concept) </li>
    <li> 12. Use your own words to explain a concept (If you just repeat the dictionary definition you'll be less likely to remember it)</li>
    <li> 13. Argue with others about answers (This really challenges your brain and is the quickest way to let go of misconceptions)</li>
    <li> 14. Do. Not. Be. Afraid. Of. Office. Hours. (Invaluable resoure. <em>Its whole purpose is to help you understand concepts </em>  )</li>
    <li> 15. No substitute for practice problems (What's the point of learning if you're not gonna use it?)</li>
    <li> 16. Go the extra mile (By design many things you learn are just the tip of the iceberg. Learning more will solidify what you're already learning and may even interest you how deep a concept can go)</li>
    <li> 17. Read | Watch | Do (read text, watch/attend lectures, work on material by writing/typing. You use more senses doing these things and ultimately helps you retain knowledge)</li>
    <li> 18. Turn off your phone (Ugh I know. But it's really distracting don't you agree?)</li>
    <li> 19. Figure out exactly where you don't understand something (Instead of saying "I'm completely lost SOS think about at exactly what part you got lost. This helps pinpoint what you don't understand and now you know what to review/study")</li>
    <li> 20. Use the pomodoro technique (Simple and it works! though there are improvements...)</li>
    <li> 21. Use advance pomodoro technique -- experiment with the intervals (Everyone's different, maybe your sweet spot is around 40 mins study 15 mins break)</li>
    <li> 22. Decrease activation energy of things you want to do more (Activation energy is basically the amount of work needed to do something. For example, your books or guitar might be collecting dust somewhere you don't visit often so moving them to a place like the coffee table or living room makes it more likely you'll do them)</li>
		<li> 23. Increase activation energy of things you DON'T want to do as much (This makes it harder for you to do things like play video games, go on social media, etc.)</li>

  </ul>
